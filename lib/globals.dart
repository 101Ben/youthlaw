String homeMessage = "Thank you for visiting our Youth and Law Forum website.\n\nAs many of you know, we cancelled the April 25, 2020, Youth and Law Forum and related activities because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a matter of community health and safety. \n\nHowever, we are excited to announce that our 30th anniversary Forum of energizing, relevant sessions for middle and high-school aged youth, and their parents/guardians, will be held September 26, 2020. It will be our first virtual, on-line Forum, and you can be a part of this historic event!\n\nOur theme, “The Power of One: In Each of us a Flame,” was adopted to challenge each youth and each adult to commit to learning how to make critical differences in the areas of law and justice. There is no better time than the present for this urgent mission!\n\nPlease stay tuned to this page and links for updates on the Forum and on the Founders’ Anniversary Dinner. \n\nOur 2020 Forum is generously supported by the City of Seattle Department of Neighborhoods. Please click on the link for a roster of additional current and past collaborators and supporters.\n\nRemember: It is the Power of One!\n";

String history = "In response to deteriorating relationships between the justice system and community youth in particular, the Forum began as a First AME Church community outreach in 1990 by King County Superior Court Judges Charles V. Johnson, Ret. Judge Norma Smith Cannon, Ret.; Judge L. McCullough, and others.  The model has been replicated throughout the State of Washington.  It is as relevant today as it was in 1990.";
