String history = "In response to deteriorating relationships between the justice system and community youth in particular, the Forum began as a First AME Church community outreach in 1990 by King County Superior Court Judges Charles V. Johnson, Ret. Judge Norma Smith Cannon, Ret.; Judge L. McCullough, and others.  The model has been replicated throughout the State of Washington.  It is as relevant today as it was in 1990.";
